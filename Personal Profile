<h3>Personality tests section:&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The results of this test are similar to other tests I have done in a previous subject. It reinforces that, while I am good at certain things myself, I should endeavor to work with other people to get a more comprehensive viewpoint and range of ideas for group or joint projects. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These results, as I said above are similar to what I have received previously, as such it does not significantly change my behavior in a team. It does reinforce that I should make sure that I am understanding of people's personal positions and not assume that they will be able to do exactly as they say, as for everyone life intervenes and plans must change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When forming a team, I should make sure there are people with different personality types to complement one another, and while I may prefer to work with people that have the similar personalities and work structures to me, that I should also make effort to include other people to give more varied ideas to make a better end product together.&nbsp;</p>
